      <p class="highlight"> Hi my name is Asmi. I am in tenth grade, and I go to <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>. I have lived in San Diego for almost my whole life, and I love going to the beach and watching sunsets. To add on, my favorite season is winter and the holiday I look forward to the most is Christmas. I took AP Computer Science Principles because I wanted to get better at coding, and overall learn about the many complex applications of computers. On top of that, I like building things from scratch, and eventually watch it come into its final form.

  <h3>&#9830 Hobbies</h3>
  <div class="highlight">
  <img id="pic2" src="images/vb.png" alt="volleyball"/>
  <p class="highlight">  Outside of school, I engage in things I enjoy. My favorite sport is volleyball, and I play for the school team. When it is not the season, I play beach volleyball with my friends and family. I also like baking, and my favorite thing to bake are <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/chocolate-cheesecake-brownies/" target="_blank">cheesecake brownies</a>. Additionally, I listen to a lot of music but my favorite artist is always changing. It helps me relax, pass time when I am bored, and focus when I am studying. In conclusion, these are all small things that I love to do, and are relevant to who I am as a person.

    <h3> &#9830 Future Goals and More</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
       <img id="pic3" src="images/themet.png" alt="The Metropolitan Museum of Art"/>
  <p class="highlight" > When I am older, I would like to travel more. Some key places I want to go are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" target="_blank">Italy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" target="_blank">France</a>, as basic as it may sound. In terms of where I want to live in the future, it would probably be on the east coast. I do not think I have a certain preference for where I would want to go to college, but probably just a nice school on the east coast too. I am not too sure about what I want to do for a career, but something more business oriented.
